Part 2:
-I selected GitHub as my VCS. 
-I used the basic tutorial provided by GitHub (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
-I already had a hello-world repository, so I created a readme file to that existing repository and continued the tutorial.
 I created a branch, edited the readme within that branch, then made a pull request.
 After making the pull request, I merged the new branch with the master and deleted the duplicate branch.
