Part 1:
-I selected gVim as my text editor.
-I used an interactive tutorial (http://www.openvim.com/) and checked the commands in gVim to compare.
-The tutorial consists of 19 short segments which showed how to navigate and make simple changes from the normal mode.

Part 2:
-I selected GitHub as my VCS. 
-I used the basic tutorial provided by GitHub (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
-I already had a hello-world repository, so I created a readme file to that existing repository and continued the tutorial.
 I created a branch, edited the readme within that branch, then made a pull request.
 After making the pull request, I merged the new branch with the master and deleted the duplicate branch.
