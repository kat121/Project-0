Part 1:
-I selected gVim as my text editor.
-I used an interactive tutorial (http://www.openvim.com/) and checked the commands in gVim to compare.
-The tutorial consists of 19 short segments which showed how to navigate and make simple changes from the normal mode.

Part 2:
-I selected GitHub as my VCS. 
-I used the basic tutorial provided by GitHub (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
-I already had a hello-world repository, so I created a readme file to that existing repository and continued the tutorial.
 I created a branch, edited the readme within that branch, then made a pull request.
 After making the pull request, I merged the new branch with the master and deleted the duplicate branch.
 
Part 3:
- I would like to learn more about formatting text. Previously I used gVim to write linux commands for another class
  and it might be useful to learn how to enter special characters (for math expressions).
-I have only used GitHub once or twice before and didn't really understand what the pulling and merging really was. 
 I would like to use GitHub on a group project again, this time with a basic idea of how to use it.
-3 (4 after I commit this last part)
-I'm pretty happy with how they were done this time. 
 I suppose I could have done just a single commit, but I wanted to make a commit after each part.
